# Graphical Processing for Pangenome Linked Exploration

#### Support scripts for the visualisation of pangenome analyses in Graphia

The below scripts take a bacterial pangenome, calculate similarity matrices between both isolates and genes, and output these for use in the network analysis suite Graphia (graphia.app). 
There is also a script for converting the synteny map from PIRATE for use in Graphia (.gfa to .layout).

Currently, the only pangenome tools fully supported is PIRATE (https://github.com/SionBayliss/PIRATE), though in theory any gene presc/absc matrix from another suitable can be used as input.

## Usage
Use "--help" to see individual script options.

## Acknowledgements
These scripts rely heavily on the excellent adapter scripts from PIRATE, and we thank Sion Bayliss also for his advice and useful discussions.
